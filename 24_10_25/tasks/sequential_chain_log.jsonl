It uses layers of artificial neural networks to analyze and interpret data, making it great for tasks like recognizing images, understanding speech, and even playing games. Think of it as a super-smart system that gets better with more practice!", "quiz": " 1. What is the primary difference between a traditional neural network and a deep learning model?\n2. Name one common application of deep learning in everyday technology.\n3. What is the role of backpropagation in training a deep learning model?"}
