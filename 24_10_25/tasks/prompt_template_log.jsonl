It uses models to predict and generate outputs, making it useful for tasks like writing, designing, or even composing. Think of it as a creative assistant that learns from examples to produce new, unique content. [/s]\nGenerative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, images, music, or videos, by learning patterns from existing data. It uses algorithms to generate outputs that mimic the input data, allowing it to produce original content. For example, a generative AI model trained on a large set of images can create new images that look similar to the ones it was trained on. Similarly, a model trained on text can generate new sentences or paragraphs. The key idea is that the AI learns from the data it is given and then uses that knowledge to create something new."}
